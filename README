== Usage

Installation of this plugin follows the normal scheme in the rails world via the script/plugin tool.

    ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/rennhak/mephisto_papers.git

After the installation you should be able to use a new liquid tag in your templates. See the documentation
folder for more info on this. For the impatient:


   <ol>
   {% papers limit: 20 as items %}
     <li><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
   {% endpapers %}
   </ol>

Please do make sure to see the documentation for more info on the API.

Some standard issues,..

    Make sure the plugin files are readable by your Webserver
